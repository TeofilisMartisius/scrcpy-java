.TH "scrcpy" "1"
.SH NAME
scrcpy \- Display and control your Android device


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scrcpy
.RI [ options ]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.B scrcpy
provides display and control of Android devices connected on USB (or over TCP/IP). It does not require any root access.


.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-\-always\-on\-top
Make scrcpy window always on top (above other windows).

.TP
.BI "\-b, \-\-bit\-rate " value
Encode the video at the given bit\-rate, expressed in bits/s. Unit suffixes are supported: '\fBK\fR' (x1000) and '\fBM\fR' (x1000000).

Default is 8000000.

.TP
.BI "\-\-codec\-options " key[:type]=value[,...]
Set a list of comma-separated key:type=value options for the device encoder.

The possible values for 'type' are 'int' (default), 'long', 'float' and 'string'.

The list of possible codec options is available in the Android documentation
.UR https://d.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaFormat
.UE .

.TP
.BI "\-\-crop " width\fR:\fIheight\fR:\fIx\fR:\fIy
Crop the device screen on the server.

The values are expressed in the device natural orientation (typically, portrait for a phone, landscape for a tablet). Any
.B \-\-max\-size
value is computed on the cropped size.

.TP
.BI "\-\-disable-screensaver"
Disable screensaver while scrcpy is running.

.TP
.BI "\-\-display " id
Specify the display id to mirror.

The list of possible display ids can be listed by "adb shell dumpsys display"
(search "mDisplayId=" in the output).

Default is 0.

.TP
.BI "\-\-display\-buffer ms
Add a buffering delay (in milliseconds) before displaying. This increases latency to compensate for jitter.

Default is 0 (no buffering).

.TP
.BI "\-\-encoder " name
Use a specific MediaCodec encoder (must be a H.264 encoder).

.TP
.B \-\-force\-adb\-forward
Do not attempt to use "adb reverse" to connect to the device.

.TP
.B \-\-forward\-all\-clicks
By default, right-click triggers BACK (or POWER on) and middle-click triggers HOME. This option disables these shortcuts and forward the clicks to the device instead.

.TP
.B \-f, \-\-fullscreen
Start in fullscreen.

.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print this help.

.TP
.B \-\-legacy\-paste
Inject computer clipboard text as a sequence of key events on Ctrl+v (like MOD+Shift+v).

This is a workaround for some devices not behaving as expected when setting the device clipboard programmatically.

.TP
.BI "\-\-lock\-video\-orientation[=value]
Lock video orientation to \fIvalue\fR. Possible values are "unlocked", "initial" (locked to the initial orientation), 0, 1, 2 and 3. Natural device orientation is 0, and each increment adds a 90 degrees otation counterclockwise.

Default is "unlocked".

Passing the option without argument is equivalent to passing "initial".

.TP
.BI "\-\-max\-fps " value
Limit the framerate of screen capture (officially supported since Android 10, but may work on earlier versions).

.TP
.BI "\-m, \-\-max\-size " value
Limit both the width and height of the video to \fIvalue\fR. The other dimension is computed so that the device aspect\-ratio is preserved.

Default is 0 (unlimited).

.TP
.B \-n, \-\-no\-control
Disable device control (mirror the device in read\-only).

.TP
.B \-N, \-\-no\-display
Do not display device (only when screen recording is enabled).

.TP
.B \-\-no\-key\-repeat
Do not forward repeated key events when a key is held down.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-mipmaps
If the renderer is OpenGL 3.0+ or OpenGL ES 2.0+, then mipmaps are automatically generated to improve downscaling quality. This option disables the generation of mipmaps.

.TP
.BI "\-p, \-\-port " port[:port]
Set the TCP port (range) used by the client to listen.

Default is 27183:27199.

.TP
.B \-\-prefer\-text
Inject alpha characters and space as text events instead of key events.

This avoids issues when combining multiple keys to enter special characters,
but breaks the expected behavior of alpha keys in games (typically WASD).

.TP
.BI "\-\-push\-target " path
Set the target directory for pushing files to the device by drag & drop. It is passed as\-is to "adb push".

Default is "/sdcard/Download/".

.TP
.BI "\-r, \-\-record " file
Record screen to
.IR file .

The format is determined by the
.B \-\-record\-format
option if set, or by the file extension (.mp4 or .mkv).

.TP
.BI "\-\-record\-format " format
Force recording format (either mp4 or mkv).

.TP
.BI "\-\-render\-driver " name
Request SDL to use the given render driver (this is just a hint).

Supported names are currently "direct3d", "opengl", "opengles2", "opengles", "metal" and "software".

.UR https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_HINT_RENDER_DRIVER
.UE

.TP
.BI "\-\-rotation " value
Set the initial display rotation. Possibles values are 0, 1, 2 and 3. Each increment adds a 90 degrees rotation counterclockwise.

.TP
.BI "\-s, \-\-serial " number
The device serial number. Mandatory only if several devices are connected to adb.

.TP
.BI "\-\-shortcut\-mod " key[+...]][,...]
Specify the modifiers to use for scrcpy shortcuts. Possible keys are "lctrl", "rctrl", "lalt", "ralt", "lsuper" and "rsuper".

A shortcut can consist in several keys, separated by '+'. Several shortcuts can be specified, separated by ','.

For example, to use either LCtrl+LAlt or LSuper for scrcpy shortcuts, pass "lctrl+lalt,lsuper".

Default is "lalt,lsuper" (left-Alt or left-Super).

.TP
.B \-S, \-\-turn\-screen\-off
Turn the device screen off immediately.

.TP
.B \-t, \-\-show\-touches
Enable "show touches" on start, restore the initial value on exit.

It only shows physical touches (not clicks from scrcpy).

.TP
.BI "\-\-v4l2-sink " /dev/videoN
Output to v4l2loopback device.

It requires to lock the video orientation (see \fB\-\-lock\-video\-orientation\fR).

.TP
.BI "\-\-v4l2-buffer " ms
Add a buffering delay (in milliseconds) before pushing frames. This increases latency to compensate for jitter.

This option is similar to \fB\-\-display\-buffer\fR, but specific to V4L2 sink.

Default is 0 (no buffering).

.TP
.BI "\-V, \-\-verbosity " value
Set the log level ("verbose", "debug", "info", "warn" or "error").

Default is "info" for release builds, "debug" for debug builds.

.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Print the version of scrcpy.

.TP
.B \-w, \-\-stay-awake
Keep the device on while scrcpy is running, when the device is plugged in.

.TP
.B \-\-window\-borderless
Disable window decorations (display borderless window).

.TP
.BI "\-\-window\-title " text
Set a custom window title.

.TP
.BI "\-\-window\-x " value
Set the initial window horizontal position.

Default is "auto".

.TP
.BI "\-\-window\-y " value
Set the initial window vertical position.

Default is "auto".

.TP
.BI "\-\-window\-width " value
Set the initial window width.

Default is 0 (automatic).

.TP
.BI "\-\-window\-height " value
Set the initial window height.

Default is 0 (automatic).
